            Welcome to the Millie blog! A little background about my munchkin:
        </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>She is a 8 month chihuahua beagle with a mind of her own.
            </li>
            <li>She loves to scavange, snuggle, fetch, and generally cause mischief.
            </li>
            <li>When she runs you start to question if she is a dog or a bunny because she's got HOPS.
            </li>
            <li>If you have a bully stick, you have her heart.
            </li>
            <li>Her best friend is Augie (a 2 year old Australian Shephard corgie) and she will literally play with him until her body gives out.
            </li>
        </ul>

                <p>I never understood why people put their dogs in clothes until I got one.
                    Millie really needed some extra warmth in the Iowa snow,
                    so this christmas present was not only adorable but functional. I was nervous
                    Millie would refuse and try to wiggle out of it but she was absolutely unphased.
                    "If I get to play outside in the snow longer, you can strap explosives to me!"

                <p>Everyone in my family <em>says</em> that I'm Mill's favorite person
                    but it's all a facade. From the moment Millie met my dad it was 
                    "best friends" at first sight. We have a running joke of who the #1 member
                    of the family is. Needless to say the new family member permanently holds the title.
